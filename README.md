# Modeling-miniKanren-in-Redex
## **Docker Setup**

Follow the steps below to clone this repository, set up Docker, and run the application.

### **Prerequisites**
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)** – to run containers
- **[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)** – to manage multi-container applications

---

## **Installation and Setup**

Open a terminal and run:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/brysenPfingsten/Modeling-miniKanren-in-Redex.git
cd Modeling-miniKanren-in-Redex
docker login
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
Finally, visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## **Configuration**

The Docker images expect an amd64 platform. Users on Apple Silicon or other arm64 based architectures,
will need to work around this, by either

- Set the `DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM` environment variable (permanently
  by adding `export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64` to your
  `bashrc`) or
- If you regularly use Docker for other purposes, you could add a
  `platform` to the YAML file found in this directory


## **Issues**

### `Error reading from ~a`

When building with Docker on an Apple Silicon machine, some users encounter an error like the following:

```
Error: error reading from ~a
("petite")
Aborted
```


Here is a minimal test that should produce the same error:

```
$ docker run -it --platform linux/amd64 racket/racket:latest sh -c "uname -m; racket"
x86_64
Error: error reading from ~a
("petite")
Aborted
```

To resolve this, open Docker.app and under Settings > General >
Virtual Machine Options, make sure you have un-checked `Use Rosetta
for x86_64/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon`
